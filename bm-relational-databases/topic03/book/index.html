        <h1>Business Rules</h1>
<p>Members of your design team have been working with the local hospital to develop a data
model for their need to store information about patients, the patient&#39;s room number, the
patient&#39;s doctor, drug prescriptions given, and specific drug information.</p>
<p>However, they all went on vacation and left you to figure out the model. They also failed to
give you any of their documentation other than the entities and attributes illustrated here.
Instead of going back to the hospital, which could reflect poorly on your company, you’re
going to have to think about everything you know about hospitals!</p>
<p>Your task is in pairs to generate a list of business rules you think were used to arrive at the information
shown here. Use your imagination. List 10 structural rules, 5 procedural rules, and
2 programmatic rules (rules to be addressed by computer applications in the future). State
each rule as a single sentence.</p>
<p>Based on your set of business rules, draw the ERD.</p>

        <h1>Exercises</h1>
<p>You are a small database consulting company specializing in developing databases
for the medical industry. You have just been awarded the contract to develop a data
model for a database application system for a mid-size health insurance company to
keep track of health claims including patient information, provider(doctor)
information, information about patient visits to their doctor as well as prescription
drugs prescribed to patients.</p>
<p>Information such as patient name, address, phone, email etc. are needed as well as
who each patient’s primary care doctor is, their insurance ID number and insurance
company name. We also want information on each doctor such as their specialty
and what hospitals they are affiliated with as well as their phone, address etc.
Regarding the hospitals themselves we will need to know where they are located
and how to contact them.</p>
<p>The prescriptions given to each patient by a health-care provider also need to be
tracked in this particular database at this time to determine claim eligibility including
some basic information on the drug being prescribed to make sure there are no
conflicts with a patient’s other prescriptions. We need to know each drug’s name,
purpose/use and possible side effects.</p>
<p>Eventually, the database will be used to track trends and for some extrapolative
modeling based on the accumulated data. The database will be accessible in English
only right now, although plans include making it available in multiple languages
eventually. </p>
<p>Based on the business scenario stated above you will identify the database needs,
and then create a conceptual data model to support these needs.</p>
<ol>
<li>Review the types of information a medical database may contain. Read articles
and check  the internet to understand the challenges of tracking this information.</li>
<li>Research medical information to better understand your topic. Look for the type of
information you will need to track.</li>
<li>Build a list of business needs, rules and assumptions based on your scenario,
research, and objectives.</li>
<li>Develop a list of potential entities including their attributes, the attribute’s
optionality as well as a possible UID for each entity.</li>
<li>Create a preliminary Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) that meets these needs
and objectives. (Note : Create entities only, relationships will be added next)</li>
