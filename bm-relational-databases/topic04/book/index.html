        <h1>Objectives</h1>
<p>This lab will put into practice relationship transferability, types of relationships and how to deal with many to many relationships you have learned in the lectures.</p>

      </div>
     
      <div  class="ui tab segment lab" data-tab="01">
        <h1>Relationship Transferability</h1>
<p>Draw ERDs for each of the following. Draw softboxes, relationship lines, and labels for each relationship in both directions. Indicate non-transferability when appropriate.   </p>
<p>a. Each town may be the birthplace of many people. Each person must be born in one and only one town.<br>b. Each room may house one or more guests. Each guest may stay in one and only one room.<br>c. Each employee must work for one and only one department. Each department may have one or more employees.<br>d. Each hotel may be the host of one or more guests. Each guest may be hosted in one or more hotels.<br>e. Each message must be addressed to one or more persons. Each person may be the addressee of one or more messages. 
f. Each garment must have one and only one price. Each price may be for one or more garments.
g. Each airline coupon must be used for one and only one destination. Each destination may be visited with one or more coupons.<br>h. Each automobile must use one and only one tire size. Each tire size may be used by one or more automobiles.<br>i. Each child must have one and only one biological mother. Each mother must be the parent of one or more children.
j. Each person must be of one and only one blood type. Each blood type may classify one or more persons.<br>k. A person may be on one or more junk-mail lists. Each junk list may contain one or more persons.<br>l. Each student may learn from one or more teachers. Each teacher may educate one or more students.<br>m. Each school may be attended by one or more honor students. Each honor student must attend one and only one school.<br>n. Each fingerprint must belong to one and only one person. Each person must have one and only one fingerprint.  </p>

      <div  class="ui tab segment lab" data-tab="02">
        <h1>Relationship Types</h1>
<p>Draw an entity relationship diagram to represent the following:  </p>
<ul>
<li>a. Each CLUB must be assigned to one and only one DEPARTMENT </li>
<li>b. Each DEPARTMENT may be responsible for one or more CLUBs </li>
<li>c. Each STUDENT may join one or more CLUBs </li>
<li>d. Each CLUB may be composed of one or more STUDENTs </li>
</ul>
<h2>Resolving many to many relationships</h2>
<p>Resolve the M:M between TEACHER and CLASS as well as INTERPRETER and LANGUAGE.<br>For each intersection entity, think of additional attributes like a UID. </p>
<p><img src="./img/01.png" alt=""></p>
<h1>Health Insurance Company</h1>
<p>Continue to work on the business description from lab03 in the Exercises step. You should have a first draft ER diagram which contains the entities you have identified.</p>
<p>You should have entities similar to below:</p>
<p><img src="./img/02.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Next you want to  track the visits a patient makes to their doctor.
Some patient visits are related to a new issue/illness, some are follow up visits to an
existing diagnosis and some visits are routine “well patient” visits or checkups. We
would like to be able to track which type of visit each instance is so we can keep
specific information regarding the visit. </p>
<p>For example :</p>
<ol>
<li>For a new issue/illness visit we will store an initial diagnosis</li>
<li>For follow-up visits we need to keep track of the patient’s status regarding the
diagnosis</li>
<li>For routine checkups we need to track patient vital information such as
current blood pressure, height and weight and if any condition is discovered a
diagnosis will be noted.</li>
</ol>
<p>Modify the ERD using a supertype/subtype structure within the Office Visit entity.</p>
<p>Next you need to identify the relationships that exist between these entities.</p>
<p>Make sure you have the following relationship identified and drawn on your diagram:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each PATIENT must have one and only one DOCTOR (their primary
doctor)</li>
<li>Each DOCTOR may treat one or more PATIENT.</li>
<li>Each DOCTOR may have one or more HOSPITAL AFFILIATION.</li>
<li>Each HOSPITAL AFFILIATION must be for one and only one DOCTOR.</li>
<li>Each HOSPITAL may have one or more HOSPITAL AFFILIATION.</li>
<li>Each HOSPITAL AFFILIATION must be for one and only one HOSPITAL.</li>
<li>Each PATIENT may be given one or more PRESCRIPTION.</li>
<li>Each PRESCRIPTION must be for one and only one PATIENT.</li>
<li>Each PATIENT may have one or more OFFICE VISIT.</li>
<li>Each OFFICE VISIT must be for one and only one PATIENT.</li>
<li>Each DOCTOR may preside over one or more OFFICE VISIT.</li>
<li>Each OFFICE VISIT must be presided over by one and only one DOCTOR.</li>
<li>Each DOCTOR may prescribe one or more PRESCRIPTION.</li>
<li>Each PRESCRIPTION must be prescribed by one and only one DOCTOR.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some relationships will be transferrable and some non-transferrable – be sure
to illustrate this point on the ERD. For example once a prescription is written
for a patient it cannot be transferred to another patient. </p>
<p>The possible relationship types are : 1-to-1, 1-to-many and many-to-many.</p>
<p>Any many-to-many relationships will need to be resolved. For example each
doctor may be affiliated with many hospitals and each hospital may have
many doctors affiliated with it. We need to make sure the many-to-many
relationships are resolved.</p>
<p>Modify your diagram to include the relationships and resolve any many to many relationships.</p>

        <h2>Practice</h2>
<p>Draw an EER for the following business scenario:</p>
<p>Ringit is a phone repair shop in Dundrum, Co. Dublin. It repairs all makes of standard
landline and mobile phones for its customers. It has six qualified technicians who fix
the phones. For each phone they store the phone number and phone make and the
service provider, i.e. Vodaphone/O2 etc. For mobile phones it stores its camera
specifications and its memory size. When a customer leaves in a phone for repair they
fill out a repair request form.
Each repair request form has a unique reference number. This form must state a brief
description of the fault, and the date the phone was left in. When the phone is
eventually fixed, the fix date is recorded on the form. The customer is then notified
thus we need to store the name, address and contact number of each customer.
Sometimes the phone needs to be sent back to the manufacturer so the name, address
and contact telephone numbers of each manufacturer is stored as well as the date the
phone was sent to the manufacturer. Some problem phones may be returned to the
shop or the manufacturer for repair a number of times. Every time a phone is returned
to the shop, a new repair request from is assigned to it.
The technicians’ IDs, names, salaries and addresses are also stored.</p>
<p>Identify any transferability in relationships that should be noted. Also resolve any many to many relationships.</p>
